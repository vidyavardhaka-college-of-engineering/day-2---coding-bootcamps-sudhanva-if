//Write a C program to declare two int numbers L1, L2 and initialise them to 10 and 20 respectively. And then print the value of L1 and L2.
//Expected Output:
//L1 = 10
//L2 = 20

#include<stdio.h>
int main()

//Write your code below this line
int L1=10;
int L2=20;
printf("%d\n",L1);
printf("%d\n",L2);
